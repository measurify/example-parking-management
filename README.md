#ParkingAdvisor

This app is an instrument to avoid fines, this app should alert you when an impediment occurs near the parking.

This app is thought for people who live in cities where parkings have often impediments like payment parkigs, street washing, or others impediments, so this ap should help users to be notified wherever these things could happen.
In particular this app should save the car position in a server and compare with the impedimentes that are known to the server, so that user will receive a notification with an advance defined by the user (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and one day).
Since the car's position has been saved in a server, more than one user that share the same account would be able to see the current car position pn their smartphones.


#Operation

Before starting the application will ask user to enable geolocalization permission, evenmore while the application is running the GPS and the internet connection must be enabled.

When the app runs, you have to sign in or log in an account, then the app will show you the main activity, here you have to choose the city where you will park, 
and when you are ready to go, you will put the phone in your pocket (the app will understand when you have arrived).
In the men√π you can also change the account, see where you have parked and the impediment around you, change the time in which the app will alert you.

#Quick start

You have to install Android Studio, open this project, sync the phone with Android Studio via Usb - which is the most simple way - then debug the app and Android Studio
will install it.
